404
Guess this ain't the page you're looking for
On this website there are thousands more
With no error 404

Suddenly
This is not the page you thought you'd see
But it's not an error 403
Yes, 404s come easily

Why it has to show, I don't know
Or what it's for
You typed something wrong?
Here's no song - it's 404

404
Adding 1% to twenty score
(I put that line in 'cause it scans, no more)
"Goodbye" from error 404
